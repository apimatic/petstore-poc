### Getting Started with Swagger Petstore - OpenAPI 3.0

## Introduction

This API Documentation Portal is created by APIMatic for Swaggerâ€™s Pet Store API. You can find out more about Swagger at [https://swagger.io](https://swagger.io/).
In the third iteration of the Pet Store, the team at Swagger have switched to the design first approach and created an OpenAPI 3.0 specification for their API!
Apimatic has used the new OpenAPI 3.0 specification file to generate this portal and the SDKs included in it.
