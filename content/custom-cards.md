# Enhancing Documentation with Custom Cards

*APIMatic* allows you to enhance your documentation using custom HTML and CSS elements. Below is an example of how you can incorporate custom cards.

## Custom Cards

You can create custom cards by defining your own CSS. Here's an example:

<div class="cards-group-wrapper">
    <div class="petstore-card">
      <div class="petstore-card-content-wrapper">
        <div class="petstore-card-info">
          Petstore is a sample API that simulates a pet shop management server. Playing around with this API documentation can help you understand how APIMatic docs provide value to you.
