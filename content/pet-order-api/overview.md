### Welcome to the APIMatic Portal Editor

You're on your way to building an awesome Developer Portal! Here's a guide to get you started.

# üìù Customize your Documentation with Custom Content

What you are looking at right now is what we call our **Custom Content**. It provides you with the ability to add additional guides to complement your API documentation.
Your guides can be anything, from product documentation to additional context for your users on how to consume your API.

The Portal Editor supports GitHub-favored Markdown, with a preview generated on the fly, so that you never have to leave this page when editing your guides.

## Add Custom Content

You can organize your custom content in sections. To get started, add a new section from the navigation menu on the left. You can add any number of sections and can create a hierarchy with nested sections as well.

Once you have added a section, using the options in the left menu, create a new custom content page under that section and name it however you like.

Once a new custom content page has been added, you can write the content with GitHub-favored Markdown. Once you are done with your changes, click the save button on the top right to save them.

Similarly, you can add any number of custom content pages under the sections and group them however you see fit.
You can also order the pages within a section, to do this, from the left menu; simply drag the desired page and drop it in the desired location.

# üìÉ Add Auto-Generated Documentation

The APIMatic Code Generator engine auto-generates documentation for your API in HTTP and the languages that you have signed up for.
There are three types of auto-generated content that APIMatic provides out of the box

- getting-started: This is an auto-generated guide for your users to get them started with consuming your API.
- endpoints: This is the documentation of your API endpoints.
- models: This is the documentation of the models present in your API.

By default, all three of these are added to your Documentation Portal at the root level. You can choose to reorganize them into sections and reorder them.
To do this, from the left menu, first, delete the type of auto-generated content, and then re-add it to your desired section. You can also order the auto-generated content just like the custom content, by dragging and dropping it in the desired location.
